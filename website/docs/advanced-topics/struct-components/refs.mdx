title: 'Refs'
description: 'Out-of-band DOM access'
---

The `ref` keyword can be used on elements and struct components. See the page about [`NodeRef`](../../concepts/html/node-refs)
for its usage on elements. When used on a component, the ref does not bind a DOM `Element`. Instead,
the referenced `Component` binds arbitrary data when it is rendered, for example a `Scope` to itself.

The `ComponentRef` can subsequently be used to interact with the bound value. Sticking with the example of binding a `Scope`, one can
send messages to the attached component, which are handled in its `update` lifecycle method to perform side-effects or cause
a rerender. Note that `ComponentRef<_>` is generically typed and receives the type of the referenced component as argument.

Components can also forward the reference, to bind to a nested child, either another component or an element. For example, a component
wrapping an `<input>` element could forward references to that html element. In this way, components can modularly change
their internal structure without breaking consuming components.

A full example is given by an externally controlled "light switch". Note that the state of the light
is contained inside the `Light` component, and the `Room` ties this together by sending a message to the
`Light` in the callback passed to the `Switch`.
