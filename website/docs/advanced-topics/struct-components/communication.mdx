title: 'Communication with struct components'
---

You can communicate with struct components that implement the `ComponentWithRef` trait. Alike HTML elements,
such components can be referenced with the special `ref` attribute, except the reference does not bind
an `NodeRef` but a [Component Ref](advanced-topics/struct-components/refs.mdx).

A `ComponentRef` can be passed to siblings elements, forwarded from grand-parent or shared in other ways,
e.g. also with callbacks. If a component binds its own scope, this allows other components to send messages
to it, enabling inter-communication.
