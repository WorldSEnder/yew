## Parent to child messaging

Passing down new data as [props](./properties.mdx) to a child component will cause the child to rerender,
which can be understood as idempotent messages.

## Child to parent messaging

A child can communicate with its parent, if it is passed down a suitable callback via its own props.
[Example](./callbacks.mdx#passing-callbacks-as-props)

## Communicating with struct components

[Struct components](advanced-topics/struct-components/introduction.mdx) have their own section about
[communicating with them](advanced-topics/struct-components/communication.mdx).
